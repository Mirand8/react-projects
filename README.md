  - Counter APP -> increment and decrement number;
  - Movies managment -> removing and cleaning a array of movies;
  - Github Users -> access oficial github api of users and show it, there is an option to show or hide it;
  - Person Form -> add person (name and email) in array and display it. The form has validation for empty values on input;
