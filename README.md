- Until now: 
  - Counter APP -> increment and decrement number
  - Movies managment -> removing and cleaning a movies array
  - Github Users -> access oficial users github api and show, option to show/hide this users array
  - Person Form -> add person (name and email) in a array and display it. The form has validation for empty values on input
 
 - Working on: new Form using useReduce
